This is a github repository for RFM95 LoRa module compatible with Linkit One

I have modified a few things of the aerospace RadioHead library to make it compatible for LinkIt One board.

Note that the aerospace RadioHead library is a generic library which is supported for various platforms.

But this repository is only compatible with Linkit One board it will not work other boards.

This repository consists of three classes:

1. RHdriver

2. RHspi 

3. RH_RF95

The first and the last class are almost the same as the one in the aerospace RadioHead repository but with a some minor changes 
which were required especially in the constructor and the implementations of the functions. 
But the variables and functions are the same.

I modified the SPI classes available in the library and combined them into one single class i.e. RHspi class.

The main problem I was facing during using the aerospace library is that it uses the implementation of the default SPIClass of the
default SPI library of Arduino.

But since the implementations of the SPI library of Arduino and LinkIt One is diffrent I was facing problems in using this Library.

So here is a modified library which you can use.
